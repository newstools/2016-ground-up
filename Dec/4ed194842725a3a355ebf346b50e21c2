On Friday, residents in France, ward 18 in Pietermaritzburg, supported by the Treatment Action Campaign (TAC) and the local leadership, marched to demand a clinic.Residents said that travelling long distances to clinics in other areas made it difficult to access their medication and exposed them to criminals, especially in the early morning.The march started at the community hall and ended at Mvuzo High School s sports fields.Residents use Imbalenhle clinic in Pietermaritzburg and a clinic in Grange location. We have to take taxis, which is very hard because most residents in this location are unemployed, said Thobelani Gumbi, a resident. We have to hire private cars in case of emergencies. Gumbi said, We only survive by using a mobile clinic which only works on Wednesdays. That is not enough, especially for the elderly people who suffer the most. TAC KZN Deputy Provincial Chairperson Sthembiso Kunene said, Today, we are saying the health department must take this matter seriously. People are suffering and this has to end. The KZN Department of Health failed to comment.
