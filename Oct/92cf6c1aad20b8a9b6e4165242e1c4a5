Protesters at Wits University encountered a heavy police presence this morning. The university is determined to stay open. A senior academic told GroundUp this afternoon: “We had significant disruptions today but we’re operating and classes are going on, albeit with low attendance. Students and staff were seriously intimidated this morning.” A statement by the Wits Executive Team at 6pm says that the university will be open on Tuesday. All photos by Ihsaan Haffejee.
