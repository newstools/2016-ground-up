UCT Educare has been evacuated for the day after receiving an anonymous threat at 9:50am this morning.The unidentified caller told a teacher of the three- to twelve-month-old class that the Educare should not have opened today and that it should be cleared within the next hour to avoid trouble, according to an email sent by Educare management. The caller also stated that they are watching the building. This may be a hoax but we cannot take the risk, the email said. Parents were encouraged to collect their children as soon as possible to avoid any possible danger. When GroundUp arrived at the centre, five campus protection service personnel were outside. No children could be seen.
