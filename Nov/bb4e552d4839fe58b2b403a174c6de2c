After numerous complaints, including about a lack of patient confidentiality, poor service and discrimination from clinic staff, dozens of members of the Treatment Action Campaign (TAC) picketed outside the Michael Maphongwana Clinic in Khayelitsha yesterday. The TAC’s provincial treatment literacy trainer, Andile Madondile, said, “This thing of mothers being told to clean themselves after giving birth or mothers being told to change their children’s nappies outside must stop.” “Clinic security guards must stop doing clinic duties and handling patients’ confidential medical folders,” said Madondile. Madondile said that TAC acknowledges there had been improvements since issues were raised by the organisation in 2014, such as folders getting lost and patients not getting treatment. The clinic’s facility manager and sub district facility manager accepted a memorandum. It demanded an improved facility for new mothers, a safe, clean, warm and hygienic environment for newborns, respect and confidentiality for all patients, that no patients should be turned away, and additional staff and doctors. The TAC wants the issues addressed within 14 working days. GroundUp is awaiting comment from the provincial health department.
