Gonubie community members in Mzamomhle township in East London accuse the Buffalo City Metro Municipality of failing to fix what appears to be a broken sewer pipe. Stinking water is coming out of the ground. Community members claim they have been reporting the matter repeatedly to the municipality with no result."I don't know why the BCMM does not fix it. It's almost a year now waiting for them. They keep on promising to come but they never did," said Monica Zintonga.She said her kids play next to the dirty water because they lack a playground.She said she can smell the water in her house."What we want is for the municipality workers to come and check what causes this dirty water so they can fix it. We cannot live like this," said Zintonga.Mhlangabezi Xaba, who has a spaza shop nearby, said people hardly spend time in his shop. He had hoped that during the local elections it might have been fixed.Another community member selling fruit nearby said he puts up with the smell as it is one of the busiest roads in the township.Ntombomzi Xhanti accused the municipality of ignoring them.Spokesperson for the Buffalo City Metropolitan Municipality Sibusiso Cindi said it was not aware of the matter."We will investigate and provide a solution and see how can we help these residents," said Cindi. He said residents must call 043 705 1749 or 086 111 3017.
