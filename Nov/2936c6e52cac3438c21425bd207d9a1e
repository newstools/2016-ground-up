On Friday in East London, about 200 blind and visually impaired people from around the Eastern Cape participated in a big walk to raise awareness and educate motorists.Thobeka Mondli says one the big challenges she faces as a blind person is that even though they have white canes, motorists don t stop. If the government and the traffic department could assist us with road signs for blind people, it would make moving around much easier. We also wish drivers would be taught about blind people and those in wheelchairs, she said.Buthanani Mondli said taxi drivers are sometimes inconsiderate towards blind customers, failing to tell them to get off at their stop.He said blind people should be treated with respect.The walk was organised by the Konwaba Training Institute. Founded by Nandipha Bhali in 2008, it now has two campuses in Port Alfred and East London. We decided to have this walk for the blind because it is Disability Month," said Bhali.Konwaba chairperson Siyathemba Sobuthe said, Our Constitution has entrenched rights. We saw a need to cater for the rights of those with disabilities. Entertainment, activities and motivational talks were held after the walk at the City Hall.
